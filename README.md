# jSlate

jSlate enables you to setup dashboards for displaying data easily. 
A dashboard consists of widgets. Widgets are just javascript and can do anything.
A number of templates for widgets are provided to get you started.

jSlate provides a php proxy so the widgets can request data from off-site locations.
