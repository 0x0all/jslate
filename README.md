# jSlate

jSlate enables you to setup dashboards for displaying data easily.  
A dashboard consists of widgets. Widgets are just javascript and can do anything.  
A number of templates for widgets are provided to get you started.  
jSlate provides a php proxy so the widgets can request data from off-site locations.
